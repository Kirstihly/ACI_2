I really love the collision of pink and tiffany blue. So before coming up with an idea, I have already chosen the two base colors for my project. Last semester, I have created a small processing project with blue circles and pink background. This time, I want do something with rectangles.\
\
The rectangles should be created while dragging the mouse. To make it not so simple, I want this rectangles rotated so that they can form a pattern.\
\
The rectangles all have same sizes and similar light green colors at first. As soon as there is a sound, they will enlarge and change colors ranging from light green and dark blue. Here, I require the addon, ofxFFT. The positions of these rectangles may trigger four sound effects. I downloaded four free sound effects from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://freesound.org"}}{\fldrslt \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\ul \ulc0 freesound.org}}. When rectangles touch the upper bound, it will trigger \'93load_bomb_kick.wav\'94. When rectangles touch the lower bound, it will trigger \'93load_alien_bomb_timer.wav\'94. When rectangles touch the left bound, it will trigger \'93load_wire.wav\'94. When rectangles touch the right bound, it will trigger \'93load_walking.wav\'94. \
\
Also I want the screen to show the rectangles are enlarged whether by sound input or sound effects. I created a volume display. It will only work when sound effects triggered.\
\
I load two fonts to write on the screen. Displaying the project name, my name and instructions of evolving. }
